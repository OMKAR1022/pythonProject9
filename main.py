#To add the new functionality and satisfy the requirements, we can modify the codebase in the following way:

#Upgrade Spindler Batteries:
#In the codebase, there should be a class or module responsible for handling the Spindler batteries.
# Locate the code that sets the service interval for the Spindler batteries and modify it to require service after three years instead of two.
# The exact code and location will depend on the structure of the codebase, but it might look something like this:

class SpindlerBattery:
    def __init__(self):
        self.service_interval = 3  # Update the service interval to 3 years
        # Other Spindler battery initialization code


# by making this change, the Spindler batteries will now require service every three years instead of two.



#  Add Tire Servicing Criteria:
# To implement the new tire servicing criteria for Carrigan and Octoprime tires, we can modify the existing car factory class.
# Locate the section of the codebase where the tire servicing logic is handled, and update it with the new criteria.

class CarFactory:
    # Existing code for the CarFactory class

    def service_tires(self, tire_wear):
        if isinstance(tire_wear, list) and len(tire_wear) == 4:
            if self.tire_type == "Carrigan":
                if any(wear >= 0.9 for wear in tire_wear):
                    self._replace_tires()
            elif self.tire_type == "Octoprime":
                if sum(tire_wear) >= 3:
                    self._replace_tires()

    def _replace_tires(self):
        # Code for replacing tires
        pass

    # Other methods and code for the CarFactory class


#n the service_tires method, we check if the tire_wear is a list of length 4.
# For Carrigan tires, we use any function to check if any of the tire wear values is greater than or equal to 0.9.
# For Octoprime tires, we use the sum function to check if the sum of all tire wear values is greater than or equal to 3.
# If the criteria are met, we call the _replace_tires method or perform any other necessary actions.
